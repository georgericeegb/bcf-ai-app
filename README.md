## Commit Message

```
üîß Fix AI market analysis modal display and enhance debugging

BREAKING CHANGES:
- Fixed displayAIMarketAnalysisResults function to properly show analysis results to users
- Enhanced runAIMarketAnalysis method with comprehensive error handling and debugging
- Replaced Bootstrap modal dependency with custom modal implementation
- Added extensive logging and DOM verification for troubleshooting

IMPROVEMENTS:
- Custom modal styling with inline CSS for better compatibility
- Direct DOM insertion using insertAdjacentHTML for reliable display
- Enhanced debugging output for function existence and execution tracking
- Improved error messages and user feedback during analysis operations

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- Removed dependency on Bootstrap modal system that was causing display failures
- Added return value tracking and DOM verification for modal elements
- Implemented timeout-based DOM checking for modal visibility confirmation
- Enhanced browser console debugging capabilities for development

TESTING:
- Verified AI API calls working correctly with proper response handling
- Confirmed modal display functionality across different browser environments
- Tested county selection and analysis workflow end-to-end
- Validated error handling and fallback mechanisms

This fix resolves the critical issue where AI market analysis was working in the 
backend but results were not being displayed to users. The solution provides a 
more robust and debuggable modal system for showing analysis results.

Files modified:
- index.html (displayAIMarketAnalysisResults, runAIMarketAnalysis methods)
- Enhanced error handling and logging throughout the workflow
